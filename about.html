            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>Musikata's mission is <strong>to help the world be more musical.</strong></p>
            <p>We believe that music is one of our greatest gifts, and we want to help more people get into music.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Why are we called 'Musikata'?</h3>
            <p>Our name is a combination of the words: <strong>Music</strong> and <strong>Kata</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Kata</strong> are sets of exercises which have been used by martial arts students for centuries.</p>
            <p>They help students master fundamental skills through regular practice. And what's cool is that <strong>they really work!</strong></p>
            <p>We think that the idea of Kata can help people learn music. They are at the heart of our dojo.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>What do we do?</h3>
            <p>In the martial arts, a dojo is a gathering place where students train. We are a <strong>musical dojo</strong>. 

            <p>We provide <strong>fun exercises, courses, and other resources</strong> that help people learn music.</p>

            <p>In addition we create space for a <strong>community</strong> of people who want to learn music together.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>What makes us different?</h3>

            <p>We're focused on making the process of learning music skills <strong>fun</strong>, <strong>effective</strong>, and <strong>soulful</strong>.

            <ul>
                <li>
                <strong>Scientific</strong>
                <p>We believe in scientific learning. What really helps people learn music and connect with each other? This is a question that fascinates us.</p> 

                <p>We try to apply the latest research to help people learn more effectively.</p>

                <p>In addition, as our members learn music, we can study what works and what doesn't.</p>

                <p>So our members are also helping us <strong>discover how people actually learn music.</strong></p>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Core Concepts</strong>
                <p>Musikata's methods are based on three main ideas:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Divide and Conquer</strong>: You can learn anything if you can break it down into simpler pieces.</li>
                    <li><strong>Daily Delight</strong>: Learning is fun and effective when you do it for at least little bit every day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Community</strong>: You learn better when you do it with other people.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>

                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
